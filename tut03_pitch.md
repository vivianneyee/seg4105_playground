## Shape Up Pitch
### notes
- don't overspecify (don't know exactly what you want until you start building, rely on estimates)
- let go of estimates and focus on budgets
- how much time the project is worth
- flexible scope (not too much detail and specs), let developers and designers figure out the details so it fits budget
- enough structure so scope is not vague
- pitch = work to do for project, not just an idea anyone can "pitch" (in this case); formalized pitch
- attempt at a solution to the problem at hand
- certain people within teams that will write pitches
- pitch should explain what solution should probably do, with room for change to fit timeline
- often times, a pitch can be for differemt problems from different customers where there are patterns, maybe a single solution to all problems is sufficient
- defer many decisions to when it is being developed
- spot rabbit holes and no gos and define tradeoffs so that project will fit within time constraint, specify what NOT to focus on/drop

### Summary
The podcast talks about the shape up pitch which is the final step in the shape up process. It is formal written document outlining the shaping work done for the solution to the problem at hand. This includes the idea, the scope, sketches, and rabbit holes and no gos. The pitch is written by certain members within teams and is meant to highlight the important details of the plan without providing too many details and specifications, and without being too vague. Finding the right balance between too much and not enough details is important. Having too much detail is too close to the waterfall method which has been proven to be ineffective for software project managements as it relies on estimates. Oftentimes, you don't know what you want to build until you start acutally building it, so eliminating estimates and focusing on the time budget, the details can be worked out during development to figure out what is needed and what is sufficient during the time alotted. This can be achieved by explaining in the pitch what the solution should probably do, with room for the developers and designers to change the scope to fit the time budget. Ideas should be expressed in simple sketches that do not contain too much detail so those working on it with more experience in design can figure out what details are necessary.

Another thing that is talked about in this podcast is the problem. Customers often will give feedback on what they think the product needs, without giving context to the problem they are facing that lead them to their solution. Shapers should consider all customer feedback and try to find patterns that may lead them to a common problem. If they can find a common problem, then they can find a common solution that solves customer complaints without implementing each individual request by each client. This means that shapers should get to the bottom of what problem the client is facing when they request a new feature, as it may have a better solution that can solve other customers' problems as well.

The last thing discussed in the podcast is rabbit holes and no gos. Shapers should try to find any potential rabbit holes that will increase the time to production and find tradeoffs or solutions to those problems before it is being developed. Although many decisions about details should be defered to when it is being developed, shapers should specify what not to focus on. This means that certain details about the project may lead to unknowns that will take weeks or longer to solve, which should be considered ahead of time so that the developers and designers can work around the unknowns to still deliver a solution to the problem with some tradeoffs to the scope.
