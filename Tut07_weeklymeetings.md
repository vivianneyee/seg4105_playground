### Scrum Guide
The scrum guide goes over the scrum methodology and how it works. Scrum is a framework made for teams to deliver products of the highest possible value in an iterative approach. Scrum based upon three pillars: transparency, inspection, and adaptation. Transparency refers to the idea that important aspects of the process to those responsible for the outcome with a common standard so that everyone involved has a common understanding of what is being seen. Inspection is the idea that teams should frequently inspect the work to find any issues. Adaptation means that adjustments must be made to the project to ensure that the product is acceptable in case of any deviation. 

Within a scrum team, there will be a product owner, a development team, and a scrum master. These teams are self-organizing and cross functional, meaning that they decide amongst themselves how to organize and accomplish their work, and have all of the competencies needed for their work without needing to depend on others outside of the team. The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product being developed by the development team by managing the product backlog. The development team will consist of professionals that deliver the work outlined by the product owner. The scrum master is responsible for enforcing scrum as defined by the scrum guide to keep the team on track following the framework. 

There are several scrum events that are of fixed time. There are sprints, which is a time-box of one month or less, where product increment is created. A new sprint begins as soon as the previous one concludes. Sprints involve the events sprint planning, daily scrums, development work, sprint review, and a sprint retrospective. Sprint planning involves taking in tasks from the backlog that are to be completed within the upcoming sprint. A sprint review is a meeting at the end of a sprint to inspect and adapt the product backlog when necessary. A sprint retrospective also occurs at the end of a sprint, where the team inspects itself and discusses how they can improve for the next sprint. 

The daily scrum is a 15 minute event that is held every day of the sprint. During this event, the team can plan their work for the next 24 hours, until the next daily scrum. This is used to optimize the team collaboration and inspecting the work since they only need to focus on one day at a time. This also optimizes the probability of meeting the sprint goal. This meeting's structure is set by the development team and can be done in different ways, but the overarching goal of this meeting is to ensure that the sprint goal will be met by the end of the sprint. Questions can be asked and discussions can be had so that team members are clear on the progress of the sprint in terms of the sprint goal. Meetings are often held after the daily standup for team members to have more detailed discussions about certain tasks and to adapt or replan some of the sprint's work. During the daily standup, the scrum master makes sure that the meeting occurs every day and stays within the 15-minute time-box. They may cut off discussions if they are not productive in the sense of what the goal of the daily scrum is. Daily scrums improve communication within the team and eliminate the need for other meetings. They also identify problems and promote quick decision making. Additionally, they keep the team up to pace with the progress of the sprint overall. 

### Shape Up Chapter 13 - Show Progress

This chapter talks about the importance of showing progress in a project and how to do it following the shape up methodology. In the early stages of shape up, there are little to no tasks outlined up front, so using a to do list to track progress has problems in showing progress. As the project progresses, more activities that need to be done will be discovered and the to do list will grow, making it unclear at earlier stages what the status of the project is. Another issue is making estimates. The estimates for projects don't take into account handling uncertainty, so an estimate can be very innacurate for the actual time it takes to complete a task. 

One way to handle showing progress while taking uncertainty into account is by using hill charts. The first half of the hill is the "uphill" portion to the top, which represents figuring out the unknowns. This way, progress for solving unknowns can be shown. Once the top of the hill has been reached, it shows that all the unknowns have been figured out and the team knows what to do to be able to complete the project. The second half of the hill represents "downhill" portion from the top, representing the execution of the project after all uncertainties are resolved. Progress along the known section of the hill shows the actual progress of the project's completion. In a hill chart, status of scopes can be plotted as different colours on the hill so we can visualize the progress of each scope within the project. With hill charts, managers can see the progress of a project without asking the team, and then from there, they can choose to have a conversation with the team about the progress since they have an idea of how the project is going.  

The unknown portion of the hill is important to show because it can signify when the scope needs to be changed. If a scope is stuck in the unknown half for a long time, management can see that there may be an issue with that scope and take steps toward changing it so that the scope can progress along the hill. In some cases, a scope may need to be split into smaller, separate scopes. 

The hill chart also helps the team to figure out the order to solve problems. If there are several problems at the bottom of the unknown section of the hill, it is wise to discuss with the team which of the problems is the most daunting, with the most unknowns to solve. This problem should be done first, since it will probably take the longest to hash out all of the uncertainties. Other projects that are easier to figure out should be saved for later to avoid adding unnecessary detail, taking up too much time to be able to complete the harder project. The team should also figure out which projects are the most important, and do those first, so that the important work is done near the end of the cycle, and all that is left are the nice-to-haves and the maybes.
