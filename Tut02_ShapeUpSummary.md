### Chapter 2 - Principles of Shaping

  This chapter explains the process of shaping. The goal of shaping is to create an idea of how to solve the problem at hand without going into too much detail and without 
being too vague. Shaping provides a design of the solution through a low-fidelity prototype (often a rough sketch) that solves the problem, provides boundaries, and gives 
developers and designers the freedom to apply their expertise when implementing the details that are not provided in the sketch. 
  Whoever is shaping must take into account what the client is asking for, if it can be done within the appetite, and if not, what trade-offs can be made to make the project 
fit within the timeline. The first step for shapers is to set boundaries for the solution to the problem. They will then create an abstract sketch of the solution they have come 
up with. After, they must assess the risks and unknowns that may send developers into a “rabbit hole,” throwing the timeline off for the project. Once this is all done, shapers 
can propose a pitch with their idea. 

### Chapter 3: Setting Boundaries

  Chapter 3 talks about setting boundaries through setting an appetite, time and scope, and figuring out the problem from raw ideas. The appetite of a project is essentially a 
time budget. Projects can be small batch, which means it will not take the team too long (about 1-2 weeks) to complete, or big batch, which means it will take the team the entire 
6 weeks to complete.
  Other things to consider for the boundaries are the time and scope. In shape up, the time is fixed which leaves the scope to be variable. Trade-offs will have to be made for 
the scope of the project to ensure that it is completed on time. Shapers need to take the fixed time into account when coming up with a solution to the problem so that the best 
solution is provided for the allotted time. This can be done by narrowing down ideas into their problem, and providing a solution that will address that problem alone to avoid 
spending time on unnecessary features. 

### Chapter 4: Finding the Elements

  This chapter talks about determining what elements are needed for the project, without going into too much detail. The two strategies mentioned are breadboarding and fat marker 
sketches. Breadboarding involves using words to  describe what is involved in the process of whatever problem you are solving. It contains arrows that follow the flow of the 
process. Items in the process can easily be deleted, altered, and moved around when done using the breadboarding technique. Fat marker sketches are rough sketches using a fat 
marker so that detail cannot be added. These are done to show the overall vision for the idea, leaving out the details that will be figured out later on by developers and 
designers. 


### Chapter 5: Risks and Rabbit Holes

  Chapter 5 discusses the risks and rabbit holes that must be considered when shaping a project. Within the 6 week timeframe of the project, risks and rabbit holes can push the 
 estimated 6 weeks to much longer. Shapers must communicate their solution with other people to get perspective on unknowns, interdependencies, and design issues in the idea that 
 could send developers and designers into a rabbit hole as there was no provided solution for certain circumstances. Shapers must set boundaries on where to stop through scope 
 hammering, and cutting back on design details so that the project can be completed in the 6 week time slot.
