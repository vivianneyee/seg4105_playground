## Betting table

The betting table will take place on October 12, 2023 at 10:00 am in SITE. All team members will have read the pitches on the basecamp project titled "Deliverable 1" prior to this time. The meeting should take no more than 30 minutes to discuss all pitches and decide on what to bet on for the next 6 weeks. We will keep track of the notes taken and comments about each of the pitches on Basecamp Docs.


## Notes and comments about Settings & Edit Information pitch
- letting users edit their info is important
- not much user information to begin with
- email should not be allowed to be changed
- ability to change password is important as well
- possibly not necessary to have dedicated page for info edit if we only can change password - maybe all we need is an option to change password in setings page and a simple page that lets users change their password
- if we make the above change, this could be a small batch project (2 weeks)
- does user need to enter current password to be able to change password? do they need to do it through email?

## Notes and comments about Login & Signup pitch
- don't know how to do email verification - potential rabbit hole
- discuss password hashing in pitch
- forgot password?
- log in immediately after creating account or redirect back to login page?

## Betting table notes
### Meeting minutes
- started with discussion on the edit profile and settings pitch
- discussed necessity of a whole page for editing profile infornation
- decided that the only necessary part of profile edit is changing password
- potentially taking in both pitches with edit profile as a small batch project instead
- we can simplify edit profile by making it just "change password"
- next we discussed the login and signup pitch
- might remove email verification for now, add it to rabbit holes in the pitch, explore further if this is feasible
- add to pitch that the system must check that the email is unique for user sign up
- decided to sign in immediately after user signs up
- login and sign up is more pressing; can't change an account if you can't make one first

### Winning pitch
- login & signup

## Changes to pitches
- remove email verification from sign up and add to rabbit holes
- check unique email
- redirect to home page after signing up instead of going back to log in
