# Betting table

The betting table will take place on October 12, 2023 at 10:00 am in SITE. All team members will have read the pitches on the basecamp project titled "Deliverable 1" prior to this time. The meeting should take no more than 30 minutes to discuss all pitches and decide on what to bet on for the next 6 weeks. We will keep track of the notes taken and comments about each of the pitches on Basecamp Docs.
