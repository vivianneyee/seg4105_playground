## Betting table

The betting table will take place on October 12, 2023 at 10:00 am in SITE. All team members will have read the pitches on the basecamp project titled "Deliverable 1" prior to this time. The meeting should take no more than 30 minutes to discuss all pitches and decide on what to bet on for the next 6 weeks. We will keep track of the notes taken and comments about each of the pitches on Basecamp Docs.


## Notes and comments about Settings & Edit Information pitch
- letting users edit their info is important
- not much user information to begin with
- email should not be allowed to be changed
- ability to change password is important as well
- possibly not necessary to have dedicated page for info edit if we only can change password - maybe all we need is an option to change password in setings page and a simple page that lets users change their password
- if we make the above change, this could be a small batch project (2 weeks)
- does user need to enter current password to be able to change password? do they need to do it through email?
