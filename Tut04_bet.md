## 7 - Bets, not Backlogs
In shape up, pitches are bet on. This means that during each six-week cycle, pitches are brought to a betting table where stakeholders will  bet on which ideas to take into the next cycle. Unlike scrum, where there is a backlog consisting of several items that will be taken into a sprint eventually, pitches that are not chosen are not saved for the next 6 week cycle to bet on. Ideas that were not bet on can be pitched again but they are not put in a queue to do later, they are ignored unless someone wants to re-pitch the idea. The ideas on the betting table are already well shaped with their risks reviewed. By not having a backlog with potentially many items to keep track of and maintain as the project is developed, having a few ideas at a time which are let go if not bet on reduces clutter. 

## 8 - The Betting Table
When betting on pitches, stakeholders have to take into account the six-week cycle. When they bet on pitches, they have to commit to them. This means that whatever ideas are taken into the cycle are the only ones that the development team will be focusing on for those 6 weeks; nothing else. Even if something comes up (i.e. bugs), they will have to wait only up to six weeks until the developers can get to them since they are promised 6 weeks of uninterrupted work on the pitches that were chosen by the stakeholders before the cycle. There are exceptions to this, like if there is a crisis that cannot wait 6 weeks, but these are rare occurrences. After the 6 weeks of focus on a certain project, there is a two week cool-down period for everyone to think about what is next and for developers to work on whatever they want (eg. bug fixes, new ideas, etc).

Along with the time constraint, stakeholders must take into account the team size. Teams are generally made up of a designer and one or two developers. The work that they cut out for each cycle has to be able to be completed within 6 weeks by two or three people. This means that they can choose either one big batch project or several small batch projects. The betting table is held during the cool-down period. Stakeholders are responsible for going over the pitches and having conversations about the pitches to gather context in their own time before the meeting. Bets consist of considering the payout, commitment and risks. Stakeholders want to bet on projects that will have a meaningful outcome at the end of six weeks. They also have to be willing to dedicate 6 weeks of uninterrupted focus on the project for the developers. Additionally, for the projects they bet on, they must be confident that if it goes poorly, the worst case scenario is that only 6 weeks are lost. 

## 9 - Place Your Bets
Shaping will be different at different stages of product development. For an existing product, shaping will be as described in the previous chapters and new features will be bet on as described above. For a new project, there are many more unknowns and no existing foundation to work from so cycles will differ as development continues. The earliest stage of new product development is R&D, where there will be a lot of trial and error. In the R&D phase, bets are made on time spent spiking key parts of the new idea and shaping will be looser. There will also be nothing expected to ship out at the end of R&D cycles. After R&D, the product will be in production mode where cycles are formal with well-shaped ides, bets and development. There are expected outcomes to be shipped out at the end of production cycles, except since it is still new, shipping refers to pushing code to the main branch instead of shipping new features to customers. After production is cleanup mode, which involves fixing bugs, and cleaning up the work that was done in production mode. Cycles will be less formal since there won't be new features developed in this phase.
