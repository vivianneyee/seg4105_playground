# Product and Project Managers: What’s the Difference?
	
   As a software developer, you may work alongside a product manager as well as a project manager. Despite the very similar job titles,
these two positions play different roles, with occasional overlap, to ensure the delivery of a successful product. To understand the 
key differences between the two roles, you must understand what is meant when referring to a “product” as opposed to a “project”. A 
product is something that can be delivered to a client whereas a project is a collection of tasks to achieve a goal. A project will 
have outcomes that go towards the overall product. For example, the product may be a website, and one of the projects is a new page 
for the website. The product manager will oversee the product throughout its lifecycle, while a project manager will supervise the 
individual projects within the product.

### Product Manager
	
  As mentioned, a product manager is responsible for overseeing the product. In the beginning stages, the product manager will set 
the vision of the product based on the clients’ needs and define key metrics to deliver a successful product. They will work with 
cross functioning teams (ie. engineering, marketing, testing, etc.) and keep track of the product’s performance as well as monitor 
the competitors. The product manager has no clear cut beginning or end to their work, as the lifecycle of a product cannot be 
determined. 

### Project Manager

  A project manager’s duties are more task-oriented. They will oversee a project from start to finish, determining their scope, 
timeline, and budget, and creating and maintaining processes for the project. They must also oversee teams and keep track of the 
tasks and the schedule. The project manager communicates with stakeholders, the product manager, and upper management to ensure that 
the scope of the project aligns with the scope and constraints of the product. The project manager has less influence or authority
over the product as a whole, and has more short term duties as a project’s timeline is much shorter than a product’s lifecycle. 

  Both the product manager and the project manager play crucial roles in software development. Oftentimes, the terms are used 
interchangeably but these two roles differ in their timelines, authority, and duties within the company. Product managers are more 
focused on the overall vision of the company, and project managers are focused on the outcomes of specific projects.
